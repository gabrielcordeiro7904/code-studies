// ARRAYS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Objects allow data to be stored in collections of keyed pairs. But quite often there's need for an ORDERED COLLECTION, where there is 1st, 2st, 3st element and so on.
// Array is the special data structure that allows ordered collection of data.
// An array expression is made with square-brackets with the data inside [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]

// MAPS & SETS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Until now, only objects and arrays have been discussed, but they're not enough on their own for real-life.
// Thats why Maps and Sets also exist.

// MAPS -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Map is a collection of keyed items, just like an Object, but the keys are not limited to string data-type.
// In maps, the keys can be of any data-type, they can even be objects them selves.
// Map data-structures also have their own set of native methods and properties, which will not be shown here for the sake of conciseness.
// --Using objects as keys is the most NOTABLE AND IMPORTANT feature of this data-structure. String as a key in object is fine, but with Maps we can use another object
// as a key in object. 

// SETS -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --Sets are another special data-structure: they are set of values (the values can be of any data-type, including objects), without keys, which the main feature is the fact
// they dont store duplicate values.
// Thats useful when you dont want duplicates, for example in a party: people visit your party, come & go but you dont want to remember how many times someone visited your party.
// An alternative would be an array and an algorithm to check for duplicates, but the performance would be much worse.
// Sets are much more optimized internally for uniqueness checks.


// DATE & TIME
// Another data type that stores data, time and provides methods for date/time management.
