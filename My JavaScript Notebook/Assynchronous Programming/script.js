// INTRODUCTION TO CALLBACKS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Some functions in Javascript are assynchronous host environments that allow you to schedule assynchronous statements.
// Some examples of assynchronous statements are scripts/modules loading statements. You can add a callback statement to execute after the loading is finished.
// Callbacks are placeholders for function arguments to execute after an assynchronous function is computed, making assynchronous programming possible.
// Thats called "Callback-based assychronous programming".

// PROMISSES & CONSUMERS
// Promisses are executors of tasks with possible outputs of resolve(value) and reject(error), consumers
