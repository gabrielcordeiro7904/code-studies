## Introduction
This chapter is all about data structures.

## Arrays
Data structure for sequences of values. It's written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas. Eg: 
`let listOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];`
The notation for the index of an array also uses square brackets:
`listOfNumbers[1]`
The index starts at 0, ends at the length value minus one

Arrays come with properties and methods from its object's prototype
Properties are values; Methods are function values!

## Objects
Data of the type Object are arbitrary collection of properties and methods. The syntax uses curly braces to create an object expresion. 
Properties are attributed a value through a collon, eg: `name : Gabriel`
Methods are simply functions inside an object expression.
