// RECURSION AND STACK --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The first topic will be about recursion. 
// Recursion is a programming pattern that is useful in tasks that are collection of tasks of the same type.
// Recursion creates a set of functions that are stored in call-stack memory, as the functions are only computed when the set-construction phase is finished.
// This is a bad design, as it uses a lot more memory than iterative functions. One recursion function can store millions of functions in the memory before it is finished.

// SCHEDULING: setTimeout and setInterval
// The function setTimeout creates a miliseconds delay to a function/code line.
// The function setInterval creates a interval for repeatdly use of a function.
